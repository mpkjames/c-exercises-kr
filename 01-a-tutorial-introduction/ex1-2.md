**_Exercise 1-2. Experiment to find out what happens when `printf`'s argument string contains `\c`, where `c` is some character not listed above._**

Replacing `c` with another character that isn't a defined escape sequence will generate a warning when compiling the program that says: `warning: unknown escape sequence '\s'`.

A list of accepted characters can be found here: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Escape_sequences_in_C#Table_of_escape_sequences](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Escape_sequences_in_C#Table_of_escape_sequences)
